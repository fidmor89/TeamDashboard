# Agrume

An iOS image viewer written in Swift with support for multiple images.

## Requirements

- Swift 2.2
- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7+

## Installation

The easiest way is through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Simply add the dependency to your `Podfile` and then `pod install`:

```ruby
pod 'Agrume', :git => 'https://github.com/JanGorman/Agrume.git'
```

Or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). Add the dependency to your `Cartfile` and then `carthage update`:

```ogdl
github "JanGorman/Agrume"
```

## How

There are multiple ways you can use the image viewer (and the included Example project shows them all).

For just a single image it's as easy as

```swift
import Agrume

@IBAction func openImage(sender: AnyObject) {
  if let image = UIImage(named: "â€¦") {
	let agrume = Agrume(image: image)
	agrume.showFrom(self)	
  }
}
```

You can also pass in an `NSURL` and Agrume will take care of the download for you.

If you're displaying a `UICollectionView` and want to add support for zooming, you can also call Agrume with an array of either images or URLs.

```swift
let agrume = Agrume(images: images, startIndex: indexPath.row, backgroundBlurStyle: .Light)
agrume.didScroll = { [unowned self] index in
  self.collectionView?.scrollToItemAtIndexPath(NSIndexPath(forRow: index, inSection: 0),
    											atScrollPosition: .allZeros,
									            animated: false)
}
agrume.showFrom(self)
```

This shows a way of keeping the zoomed library and the one in the background synced.

If you want to take control of downloading images (e.g. for caching), you can also set a download closure that calls back to Agrume to set the image. I can recommend [MapleBacon](https://github.com/zalando/MapleBacon).

```swift
import Agrume
import MapleBacon

@IBAction func openURL(sender: AnyObject) {
  let agrume = Agrume(imageURL: NSURL(string: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/512759/MapleBacon.png")!, backgroundBlurStyle: .Light)
	agrume.download = { url, completion in
	  let manager = ImageManager.sharedManager
	  manager.downloadImageAtURL(url) { imageInstance, error in
		if error == nil {
		  completion(image: imageInstance.image)
		} else {
		  completion(image: nil)
		}
	}
  }
  agrume.showFrom(self)
}
```

For more dynamic library needs you can implement the `AgrumeDataSource` protocol that supplies images to Agrume. Agrume will query the data source for the number of images and if that number changes, reload it's scrolling image view.

```swift
import Agrume

let dataSource: AgrumeDataSource = MyDataSourceImplementation()
let agrume = Agrume(dataSource: dataSource)

agrume.showFrom(self)

```
